## Introduction

We all began our journey in Honkai: Star Rail watching a mysterious woman play the violin, losing herself to the gentle, hopeful, joyous tones of Pachelbel’s Canon in D, untroubled by the worries around her: alarms rang, monsters attacked, people evacuated—and then when it came her time, she sprung into action. That was our introduction to the game, the first hook that got us interested: who was this woman, and what did she mean by “Elio,” “the script,” “Destiny’s Slave,” and her parting, almost loving speech to the protagonist, whom she awakened from some kind of stasis or slumber?

Such was our introduction to Kafka, the very first character we meet, and one who is foreshadowed to play a part through the whole Star Rail saga—along with an important place in the heart of our own character. For the many players who were fascinated by her from the moment the game began, and for those who came to enjoy her through the story, or simply for those who like damage over time gameplay, this guide is for you.

Herein, we describe the character in detail: her traits, eidolons, and playstyle, before delving into the particulars of how to build her and different teams to build around her. Kafka is the centerpiece of damage over time builds as they currently stand, being able to trigger additional “ticks” of damage with her abilities. True to her character, she creates a unique team wherever she is present.


## Optimal vs. Strong vs. Viable

The focus of this guide is on the experience of the player: we want to aid Kafka players in having the best experiences with this character in the game as possible. As such, one important facet about the philosophy behind this guide is the difference between the “optimal” team for a fight, a “strong” team for a fight, and a “viable” team for a fight. To demonstrate this, let’s consider the following scenarios: suppose you have three teams: a Quantum team, an Imaginary team, and a Fire team. Suppose we measure how quickly they clear two fights: Fight #1 against quantum-weak enemies and Fight #2 against imaginary weak enemies. We can imagine that the results may be that, for Fight #1, they cleared in this order: Quantum team, Imaginary team, Fire team. For Fight #2, they cleared in this order: Imaginary team, Quantum team, Fire team. Which team is the “optimal” team?

The correct answer would be that it depends on the enemies: Quantum for Fight #1 and Imaginary for Fight #2. But it’s possible that, say, the difference between Quantum and Imaginary teams is only roughly 10% in damage output/clear speed. We would call both of these teams “strong” teams, because their performance is very similar and close to the optimal clear speed for the fight. In that case, a player’s experience piloting those two teams will be very similar—recommending one over the other solely based on that experience wouldn’t make sense, so we would recommend both.

However, if the Fire team is lagging behind by 50%, we might not want to call the Fire team “strong”; we might instead merely call them “viable”, because they were able to clear the fight! They may even do so without any deaths and still gaining stars in Memory of Chaos. But there is a significant difference in the experience of the fight and the clear speed of the fight compared to the “strong” teams, so we wouldn’t recommend them in the same manner as we would the “strong” teams.

The division between “strong” and “viable” can be somewhat arbitrary in some cases; a full analysis would require analyzing many teams across many fights and attempting to group stronger teams together to create a clean delineation between these categories. Perhaps that will be a useful exercise for theory-crafters in the future. But based on our present knowledge and calculations across a number of simulations, we can see how certain teams are close together in damage for various scenarios, whereas some others are outliers, lacking enough in damage that they are not in the same category: the experience playing them differs significantly, particularly in higher end content.

As such, we will be using these terms through the guide: “strong” will be used for teams that may be optimal in some scenarios but are at least close to optimal for many scenarios (exceptions will be noted in the team description), so a player’s experience piloting those teams will be consistently “strong”; on the other hand, “viable” will be used for teams that work and can clear content, but whose experience and clear speed significantly lags behind the “strong” teams. We won’t discuss “optimal” teams very much, simply because, as the above discussion hopefully illustrates, a singular “optimal team for all content” is not how we approach the game. If our focus is on the experience of the player first and foremost, then recommending any strong team for the player will allow the player to choose between what they want and are able to attain, while maintaining the experience of piloting a strong, competitive Kafka team.

## Why Choose Kafka?

### Pros:

- She likes classical music

- Her voice is cool

- She is the centerpiece of the Damage over Time playstyle so far & can be combined with nearly any Damage over Time unit to form a viable team

- Her Follow-up Attack applying her Shock is surprisingly nice for auto-play and provides great consistency in damage, even without her Ultimate

- Gearing is much more pleasant and forgiving. Her damage scales heavily from Ultimate and Skill levels, and so she’s less reliant on particular gear pieces—in particular, she doesn’t need any crit pieces at all and will function great with some good main piece sets and some Speed/ATK% substats.

- Her banner contains several of her best teammates (Sampo and Luka) to make for easier team building and bonus 4 star eidolons

- Her Light Cone banner contains several of the best Light Cones for her best teammates (Luka’s Light Cone and Sampo’s Light Cone) to make for easier team building, if rolling for her signature Light Cone

### Cons:

- Her teams want Damage over Time characters, who aren’t as usable in other teams and can take many Trace materials/credits/XP mats to build (i.e. Sampo, Luka, Serval)

- Limited banner

- Heavy scaling of damage from Ultimate, Skill, and Trace levels, so Trace materials are very important to farm

## Skills and Traces
### Skills

- Basic Attack - Midnight Tumult

- Deals Lightning DMG equal to (50-100)% of Kafka's ATK to a single enemy.

- Skill - Caressing Moonlight

- Ultimate - Twilight Trill

- Deals Lightning DMG equal to (48-80)% of Kafka's ATK to all enemies, with a 100% base chance for enemies hit to become Shocked and immediately take DMG from their current Shock state, equal to (80-100)% of its original DMG. Shock lasts for 2 turn(s).

- While Shocked, enemies receive Lightning DoT equal to (116-290)% of Kafka's ATK at the beginning of each turn.

- Talent - Gentle but Cruel

- After an ally of Kafka's uses Basic ATK on an enemy target, Kafka immediately launches 1 follow-up attack and deals Lightning DMG equal to (42-140)% of her ATK to that target, with a 100% base chance to inflict Shock equivalent to that applied by her Ultimate to the attacked enemy target for 2 turns. This effect can only be triggered 1 time per turn.

- Technique - Mercy Is Not Forgiveness

- Immediately attacks all enemies within a set range. After entering battle, deals Lightning DMG equal to 50% of Kafka's ATK to all enemies, with a 100% base chance to inflict Shock equivalent to that applied by her Ultimate on every enemy target for 2 turn(s).

### Major Traces:

- Thorns

- The base chance for Ultimate, Technique, or the follow-up attack triggered by the Talent to inflict Shock increases by 30%.

- Plunder

- If an enemy is defeated while Shocked, Kafka additionally regenerates 5 Energy.

- Torture

- When the Ultimate is used, enemy targets will now receive DMG immediately from all currently applied DoT sources instead of just receiving DMG immediately from the currently applied Shock state.

### Minor Traces:
- 18% Effect Hit Rate

- 28% ATK

- 10% Max HP

## Kafka Playstyle

Kafka teams are dependent on Kafka’s procs of Damage over Time applied to enemies with her Skill and her Ultimate; thus, the best Kafka team rotations are going to be those that consistently apply Damage over Time effects and DEF/RES debuffs to enemies before trying to use as many Skill and Ultimate casts as Kafka can get. More on specific team rotations will be covered in the Team Compositions section, but it’s important to note that, outside of team specific rotational requirements (such as needing to use a Skill for a unit to get their energy filled back in time to use their Ultimate again), the goal should be to ensure Kafka uses her Skill as often as possible on Damage over Time-afflicted enemies. Ideal Kafka gameplay will have few, if any, Kafka Basic Attacks (not including her Follow-up Attack here; that should be proc’d every turn, if possible, by having an ally use a Basic Attack, as the Follow-up Attack deals damage, gains Kafka energy, and applies/re-applies her Shock to the target enemy). The rest of Kafka’s team’s playstyle revolves around how that team functions, some of which are covered in more detail later.

### Opener

If Kafka doesn’t have her Ultimate available and will be facing multiple enemies (as is usually the case), then it’s best to begin with Kafka’s Technique so as to apply Shock to all enemy units, so that she can use her Skill on her first turn and proc her Shock again. Otherwise, against a single target, an ally can use a Basic Attack to trigger Kafka’s Follow-up to apply her Shock (if said ally is faster than Kafka).

The remainder of the rotation depends on which team Kafka is in, though in general, Kafka could attempt to always use her Skill until she can cast her Ultimate.

## Eidolons

Kafka’s Eidolons, in general, give fairly significant damage increases but are unnecessary for Kafka’s core gameplay loop. The eidolons are listed below with some sample percent damage increases, though these are not absolute; they indicate the approximate damage increase one might expect for some of the fully built Kafka teams noted in the “Team Compositions” section, so the damage gained by some eidolons may differ from these projections based on how one’s Kafka team is built.

===

E1: Da Capo - ~17% more team damage against a single target
When the Talent triggers a follow-up attack, there is a 100% base chance to increase the DoT received by the target by 30% for 2 turn(s).

===

E2: Fortississimo - ~11% more team damage
While Kafka is on the field, DoT dealt by all allies increases by 25%.

===

E3: Capriccio
Skill Lv. +2, up to a maximum of Lv. 15.
Basic ATK Lv. +1, up to a maximum of Lv. 10.

===

E4: Recitativo - with ERR rope and Kafka’s signature Light Cone, this allows for a 2 turn Ultimate rotation (if using her Skill twice in a row)
When an enemy target takes DMG from the Shock status inflicted by Kafka, Kafka additionally regenerates 2 Energy.

===

E5: Doloroso - E3 and E5 combined give about 6% more team damage
Ultimate Lv. +2, up to a maximum of Lv. 15.
Talent Lv. +2, up to a maximum of Lv. 15.

===

E6: Leggiero - ~16% more team damage
The Shock inflicted on the enemy target by the Ultimate, the Technique, or the Talent-triggered follow-up attack has a DMG multiplier increase of 156% and lasts 1 turn(s) longer.

===

If we rank the Eidolons for their approximate contribution for team damage: E1 > E2 > E6 > E5/E3, with E4 giving us potential for a 2 turn Ultimate rotation cycle even against a single target—this grows further in value against multiple targets and Lightning-weak enemies.

## Light Cones

Kafka’s initial Light Cone banner has a very strong line-up: her signature Light Cone, Patience is All You Need, Luka’s 4 star Light Cone, Resolution Shines as Pearls of Sweat, Sampo’s 4 star Light Cone, Eyes of Prey, and an admittedly less useful option for us, The Birth of the Self (which is not Nihility, so it isn’t useful for Kafka or her Nihility teammates). While we’ll discuss her team compositions in the section to follow, we will list Luka and Sampo’s light cone preferences here, given that we can roll for not just Kafka’s Light Cones, but also Luka’s and Sampo’s Light Cones at the same time with this banner. With the information provided, the choice to roll on her Light Cone banner or not should be more clear by the end of this section.

### 1. Patience Is All You Need

{{< figure
    src="img/patience.png"
    alt="Patience Is All You Need"
    caption="5 Star Signature Light Cone"
    >}}

This is Kafka’s best Light Cone in general, thanks to the significant Speed buff it gives her (14.4 SPD on Kafka for S1, full stacks). In addition, if the player does not have access to a Superimposition 5 Resolution Shines as Pearls in Sweat or a Superimposition 5 Eyes of Prey and they plan to run Luka/Sampo respectively, then this Light Cone banner is very valuable; you improve the Light Cone options for multiple essential damage characters for the team. However, if the player already has Good Night, Sleep Well with a high Superimposition, as well as appropriately strong Light Cones for Luka/Sampo (if they plan to use them), then the additional value of Patience is All You Need may not be worth the cost to roll for it: it does not provide significant gains over S5 Good Night, Sleep Well—some simulations have it at only around 2-5% more damage.

### 2. Good Night, Sleep Well

{{< figure
    src="img/goodnight.png"
    alt="Good Night, Sleep Well"
    caption="Best 4 Star Light Cone"
    >}}

This Light Cone, at high Superimposition levels (ideally a full 5), provides a very strong alternative to Patience is All You Need, with the damage gain being dependent on how many DMG% increase modifiers one has on the target character. For Kafka, due to the relative scarcity of DMG% increase modifiers compared to the many ATK% increase modifiers she has, Good Night, Sleep Well performs very well, only a few percent less damage on average than Kafka’s signature Light Cone.
This Light Cone can also be the best Light Cone for other characters as well under most conditions—Sampo and Luka, for example, perform very well with Good Night, Sleep Well, even compared to their signature 4 star Light Cone.
It should be noted that this is strictly for high Superimposition values; for lower values, such as S1, Good Night, Sleep Well doesn’t perform nearly as well, becoming more comparable to S5 Eyes of Prey and S5 Fermata in damage (without even taking the latter’s Break Effect into account).

### 3. Eyes Of The Prey

{{< figure
    src="img/prey.png"
    alt="Eyes Of The Prey"
    caption="Super Imposition 5 Recommended"
    >}}

This Light Cone, at superimposition 5, provides a good deal of DMG% multiplier for Damage over Time. The additional Effect Hit Rate is a bit wasted on Kafka, compared to how effective that would be on Sampo—for that reason, if the player is planning on using Sampo, giving Sampo this Light Cone would be preferable. However, in the event that’s not the case and the player doesn’t have either of the above Light Cones, Eyes of Prey provides slightly more damage value than other options, particularly with Kafka’s E1, since E1 requires more Effect Hit Rate to proc the DoT Damage Taken modifier.

### 4. In The Name Of The World

{{< figure
    src="img/world.png"
    alt="In The Name Of The World"
    caption="Second Best 5 Star"
    >}}

Welt’s signature Light Cone is not as effective as other options, simply because part of the Light Cone’s scaling is ATK%, whereas we want DMG% scaling more, since we tend to have a great many more ATK% modifiers than DMG% modifiers (meaning the latter are more effective for each point than the former).

### 5. Fermata

{{< figure
    src="img/fermata.png"
    alt="Fermata"
    caption="The First Kafka"
    >}}

This Light Cone is by far the easiest to obtain, being available from the Forgotten Halls vendor and able to drop in the weekly Echo of War fights. The damage difference from an S5 Fermata and an S1 Patience is All You Need (without taking Break Effect into account) is around 13% in terms of team damage for some of the standard teams we’ve tested with, and this greatly improves against Lightning-weak enemies (only an 8% damage difference then)—so if the player doesn’t have the economy to attempt to get a better Light Cone, S5 Fermata is certainly a solid, strong option for Kafka and is very easy to attain and max. Due to this, Kafka players should never be overly concerned about whether or not they can get a good Light Cone for her.

## E1 or Signature Light Cone?

This is a common question for players who have enough economy to roll for Kafka and either a second copy for her first eidolon or her signature light cone.

The primary considerations for the player is what Light Cones the player has for their Kafka team, and whether that team includes Luka and/or Sampo, because the Kafka banner includes both of those characters, and the Kafka Light Cone banner has good Light Cones for both of those characters. So let’s take two of the more extreme situations and see where we stand.

In the first case, where the player has Kafka, Sampo, and Luka (the latter two at high eidolon values) and intends to run the three of them, the player then looks at their Light Cones and finds that they don’t have any besides an S5 Fermata and an S1 Eyes of Prey. In this case, rolling for the Light Cone banner gets us a great deal of value: we get Kafka’s best Light Cone, we get a (hopefully high superimposition) Resolution Shines as Pearls of Sweat, and we get more superimpositions for Eyes of Prey, which are respectively good for Luka and Sampo. The team damage gained by these outpace the ~17% from Kafka’s E1.

In the second case, where the player doesn’t intend to run Sampo or Luka but rather wants to run Serval (who doesn’t use any Nihility Light Cones), and the player has Good Night, Sleep Well at a high superimposition, then Kafka’s E1 is much better value: the difference from S5 GNSW and S1 PAYN is only in the ballpark of 4% more team damage, whereas Kafka’s E1 gains around 17% team damage overall. The same is true for a number of other Light Cones: even the difference for Kafka’s damage from S5 Fermata, which is fairly easy and free to grind for, being a F2P Light Cone, and S1 PAYN is only around 12% or 13%, still less than Kafka’s E1.

But if we add in Luka’s S5 Resolution Shines as Pearls in Sweat, we can gain another 8% damage, which would surpass E1’s team damage bonus. These numbers can vary, of course, but the general conclusion is clear: the choice between rolling for E1 and Kafka’s signature Light Cone very much depends on what Light Cones the player presently has and what team(s) they want to run.

**The more Nihility Light Cones they need, the better value they get from the Light Cone banner; otherwise, rolling for E1 and more Luka/Sampo eidolons is a valuable alternative.**

## Relics

Relic composition depends on two factors: the main stats and relic/planetary ornament sets, as well as the substats available to be rolled on said relics. We will detail the best sets, the best main stat combinations, and then the order to consider substats for after listing what the substat requirements are for Kafka.

For Effect Hit Rate: Kafka is in a unique situation where her E0 (no eidolon) build requires less Effect Hit Rate than her first eidolon, as her first eidolon has a 100% base hit chance, whereas her other effects have a 130% hit chance thanks to her major Traces buffing their hit chance, but not buffing her first eidolon.

- **For E0:** There is only a 29% EHR requirement, which is satisfied by 3 substat rolls (11.67%) combined with her minor traces (18%).

- **For E1:** There is a 66.7% EHR requirement to always land it (though you can fall below this without significant loss of damage), which is satisfied by 12 substat rolls (46% - would be slightly under 67% total) or an EHR main chest piece (43.2%—losing the ATK% is likely not worth it though) combined with 2 substat rolls (7.78%) and her minor traces (18%).

**For SPD:** More details on precise breakpoints and methodology are in the later Speed section, but for now, note that SPD is valuable, particularly in hitting some of the early breakpoints, so long as you scale it on all your team consistently, leaving no one too far behind in SPD, or else your rotation will suffer over longer fights.

**For ATK%:** We want to scale this along with SPD as our highest priority substats.

**For other substats**, we can be fine with Break Effect (especially if one wants to focus on synergy with Ruan Mei or other Break Effect-scaling characters), Flat ATK, and Crit Rate/Crit DMG, though these pale in comparison to SPD and ATK% in terms of their effect on damage output, so they should not be made a priority to roll for. In particular, attempting to scale Crit Rate/DMG does scale as effectively with Kafka as with other units, as her Damage over Time procs are unaffected by critical strikes.

**Main Stats:**

- **Body:** Unless Kafka is E1 and EHR substats are proving hard to find (in which case you may want to go EHR% Body, though that is generally nonoptimal), the player will always want ATK% Body.

- **Boots:** Whether to go SPD or ATK% Boots depends on what Speed you have and/or want for the team, along with what SPD substats you have, whether you are doing the Asta uptime team or not, etc. If the player decides to just go with one or the other, there isn’t a large amount of damage at stake, so it works either way.

- **Sphere:** Kafka will always benefit more from Lightning DMG% main stat on Sphere, due to the relative scarcity of DMG% modifiers compared to ATK% modifiers.

- **Rope:** If Kafka has her fourth eidolon, she may be able to go Energy Regeneration Rate for reducing her three turn Ultimate rotation to two turns; otherwise, she will want ATK%.

### Relic Sets

- **4 piece Prisoner in Deep Confinement** - The new standard set for Kafka, as the DEF Ignore is very valuable. This is ideal to use if you’re able to maintain multiple DoTs on enemies (Erode from Kafka’s signature Light Cone counts as one, so Kafka alone can provide 2).

- **4 piece Band of Sizzling Thunder** - The previous standard set for Kafka, but the new DoT set (listed above) scales better if your team is able to keep 3 DoTs on the enemy (for which Erode from Kafka’s signature Light Cone counts), particularly so with upcoming Damage over Time units.

- **2 piece Band of Sizzling Thunder, 2 piece Musketeer of Wild Wheat** - This is very close to 4 piece Lightning; if not using the Prisoner set for whatever reason, it’s advised to use whichever has better substats, though 4 piece Lightning is slightly better (8 ATK%) in ideal conditions.

- **2 piece Band of Sizzling Thunder, 2 piece Messenger Traversing Hackerspace** - This set is useful if Kafka needs 2 or 3 more Speed substats (as it gives 6 SPD for Kafka).

### Planar Ornament Sets

- **Firmament Frontline: Glamoth** - This is a new set that, since Kafka teams enjoy stacking SPD, will provide strictly more value than Space Sealing Station, since it provides a DMG bonus instead of simply more ATK%.

- **Space Sealing Station** - This is the only other set that Kafka builds will run, as we want well over 120 Speed and we scale well off of ATK%; the other planetary ornament sets, besides Firmament listed above, do not contribute as much as this set.

### Speed

Speed in Honkai: Star Rail is a complicated topic to delve into for those who want to optimize their team as fully as possible. As we noted in the Introduction, there are multiple strong teams for Kafka, and these vary in their Speed requirements as well; the difference between two teams, one with slightly more ATK% than SPD, can often be negligible.

It’s absolutely worth investing into Speed, and among some teams, some Speed tuning can be important (i.e. making some characters faster than others, for example). But it is also important to note that **precise Cycle Speed breakpoints are not guarantees—they are relevant when clearing the fight in that turn/cycle.** If you clear earlier or later than that turn in that Cycle, then a lesser Speed can give the exact same result (in terms of number of Cycles).

Let's take the example of the 164 Speed breakpoint. We calculate this breakpoint via the following math: we want to do 9 turns by the end of the fifth cycle. The total AV across all five cycles is 150 + 4*100 = 550 AV total. So we need to find a Speed such that we get 9 actions within 550 AV. That would be: 550 = 9 x 10000/SPD -> SPD = 90000/550, which is about 163.63636363, so our breakpoint is 163.7 SPD. If the fight would end on the 9th turn, then this is a useful Speed breakpoint to achieve, since we then end in the fifth Cycle instead of the sixth Cycle.

But there is a problem with this: first and most obvious problem would be clearing before 9 turns, making this Speed breakpoint irrelevant; but it is also a problem if the fight lasts longer than 9 turns (say, 11 turns), as then 163 Speed gets you those 11 turns in the same number of cycles as 164 Speed does. Same with 162 Speed. So, in that specific fight, there's no benefit for getting 163.7 SPD over 162 SPD. In other words,** specific Cycle Speed breakpoints for 'get X turns in Y cycles' are specifically beneficial for ending the fight at the Xth turn in the Yth Cycle.** Otherwise, a lower Speed can potentially attain the exact same result.

Accordingly, **the best advice is to follow our general recommendations for pursuing SPD and ATK% relic substats first and foremost without caring as much for fine-tuning a specific Cycle Speed breakpoint**, as those breakpoints do not always matter per fight.

### Difficulties with Optimizing Speed for Kafka Teams

The difficulty in discussing speed on artifacts comes down to the extreme variability and relative rarity of Speed rolls, as well as the extremely conditional nature of Speed in fights. As noted above, unless you’re clearing a fight at a specific turn in a specific Cycle, that associated Speed breakpoint may not get much value over a lower Speed.

This becomes more complicated when taking into account variable Speed—Kafka’s signature Light Cone, Asta’s ultimate, the Messenger Traversing Hackerspace 4 piece set bonus, and Luocha’s signature Light Cone, among others, are all sources of Speed that may not have full uptime, and said uptime may differ between fights.

Lastly, we cannot guarantee or fine tune our Speed substats to begin with, unless we level hundreds and hundreds of relics, which is beyond what most players are willing to do.

All of the above means that we cannot find a single optimal Speed for every fight; we can only find Speeds optimal for some fights and some scenarios, and as such, this Guide will not attempt to provide a strict optimization. Rather, we will note some important general details regarding Speed for Kafka teams which will allow for the most overall consistency playing Kafka teams:

- Since Speed is so conditional in its use, it is folly to state that a certain extra Speed stat is more optimal than an ATK% stat instead; but it is equally as folly to state that the ATK% stat is more optimal than the Speed stat, because in some cases, the former is true, and in the other cases, the latter is true. Until and unless a robust Monte Carlo-style simulation is able to test hundreds of permutations of fights on a certain team (which would then tell us how, on average, a certain team and gear setup would perform over hundreds of fights—this is what srsim aims to do), we cannot realistically provide an objective answer to that question. The player is free to go with either ATK% or SPD according to their preference; presently, there is no known optimal choice, oftentimes.
