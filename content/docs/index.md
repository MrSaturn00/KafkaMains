## Introduction

We all began our journey in Honkai: Star Rail watching a mysterious woman play the violin, losing herself to the gentle, hopeful, joyous tones of Pachelbel’s Canon in D, untroubled by the worries around her: alarms rang, monsters attacked, people evacuated—and then when it came her time, she sprung into action. That was our introduction to the game, the first hook that got us interested: who was this woman, and what did she mean by “Elio,” “the script,” “Destiny’s Slave,” and her parting, almost loving speech to the protagonist, whom she awakened from some kind of stasis or slumber?

Such was our introduction to Kafka, the very first character we meet, and one who is foreshadowed to play a part through the whole Star Rail saga—along with an important place in the heart of our own character. For the many players who were fascinated by her from the moment the game began, and for those who came to enjoy her through the story, or simply for those who like damage over time gameplay, this guide is for you.

Herein, we describe the character in detail: her traits, eidolons, and playstyle, before delving into the particulars of how to build her and different teams to build around her. Kafka is the centerpiece of damage over time builds as they currently stand, being able to trigger additional “ticks” of damage with her abilities. True to her character, she creates a unique team wherever she is present.


## Optimal vs. Strong vs. Viable

The focus of this guide is on the experience of the player: we want to aid Kafka players in having the best experiences with this character in the game as possible. As such, one important facet about the philosophy behind this guide is the difference between the “optimal” team for a fight, a “strong” team for a fight, and a “viable” team for a fight. To demonstrate this, let’s consider the following scenarios: suppose you have three teams: a Quantum team, an Imaginary team, and a Fire team. Suppose we measure how quickly they clear two fights: Fight #1 against quantum-weak enemies and Fight #2 against imaginary weak enemies. We can imagine that the results may be that, for Fight #1, they cleared in this order: Quantum team, Imaginary team, Fire team. For Fight #2, they cleared in this order: Imaginary team, Quantum team, Fire team. Which team is the “optimal” team?

The correct answer would be that it depends on the enemies: Quantum for Fight #1 and Imaginary for Fight #2. But it’s possible that, say, the difference between Quantum and Imaginary teams is only roughly 10% in damage output/clear speed. We would call both of these teams “strong” teams, because their performance is very similar and close to the optimal clear speed for the fight. In that case, a player’s experience piloting those two teams will be very similar—recommending one over the other solely based on that experience wouldn’t make sense, so we would recommend both.

However, if the Fire team is lagging behind by 50%, we might not want to call the Fire team “strong”; we might instead merely call them “viable”, because they were able to clear the fight! They may even do so without any deaths and still gaining stars in Memory of Chaos. But there is a significant difference in the experience of the fight and the clear speed of the fight compared to the “strong” teams, so we wouldn’t recommend them in the same manner as we would the “strong” teams.

The division between “strong” and “viable” can be somewhat arbitrary in some cases; a full analysis would require analyzing many teams across many fights and attempting to group stronger teams together to create a clean delineation between these categories. Perhaps that will be a useful exercise for theory-crafters in the future. But based on our present knowledge and calculations across a number of simulations, we can see how certain teams are close together in damage for various scenarios, whereas some others are outliers, lacking enough in damage that they are not in the same category: the experience playing them differs significantly, particularly in higher end content.

As such, we will be using these terms through the guide: “strong” will be used for teams that may be optimal in some scenarios but are at least close to optimal for many scenarios (exceptions will be noted in the team description), so a player’s experience piloting those teams will be consistently “strong”; on the other hand, “viable” will be used for teams that work and can clear content, but whose experience and clear speed significantly lags behind the “strong” teams. We won’t discuss “optimal” teams very much, simply because, as the above discussion hopefully illustrates, a singular “optimal team for all content” is not how we approach the game. If our focus is on the experience of the player first and foremost, then recommending any strong team for the player will allow the player to choose between what they want and are able to attain, while maintaining the experience of piloting a strong, competitive Kafka team.

## Why Choose Kafka?

### Pros:

- She likes classical music

- Her voice is cool

- She is the centerpiece of the Damage over Time playstyle so far & can be combined with nearly any Damage over Time unit to form a viable team

- Her Follow-up Attack applying her Shock is surprisingly nice for auto-play and provides great consistency in damage, even without her Ultimate

- Gearing is much more pleasant and forgiving. Her damage scales heavily from Ultimate and Skill levels, and so she’s less reliant on particular gear pieces—in particular, she doesn’t need any crit pieces at all and will function great with some good main piece sets and some Speed/ATK% substats.

- Her banner contains several of her best teammates (Sampo and Luka) to make for easier team building and bonus 4 star eidolons

- Her Light Cone banner contains several of the best Light Cones for her best teammates (Luka’s Light Cone and Sampo’s Light Cone) to make for easier team building, if rolling for her signature Light Cone

### Cons:

- Her teams want Damage over Time characters, who aren’t as usable in other teams and can take many Trace materials/credits/XP mats to build (i.e. Sampo, Luka, Serval)

- Limited banner

- Heavy scaling of damage from Ultimate, Skill, and Trace levels, so Trace materials are very important to farm

## Skills and Traces
### Skills

- Basic Attack - Midnight Tumult

- Deals Lightning DMG equal to (50-100)% of Kafka's ATK to a single enemy.

- Skill - Caressing Moonlight

- Ultimate - Twilight Trill

- Deals Lightning DMG equal to (48-80)% of Kafka's ATK to all enemies, with a 100% base chance for enemies hit to become Shocked and immediately take DMG from their current Shock state, equal to (80-100)% of its original DMG. Shock lasts for 2 turn(s).

- While Shocked, enemies receive Lightning DoT equal to (116-290)% of Kafka's ATK at the beginning of each turn.

- Talent - Gentle but Cruel

- After an ally of Kafka's uses Basic ATK on an enemy target, Kafka immediately launches 1 follow-up attack and deals Lightning DMG equal to (42-140)% of her ATK to that target, with a 100% base chance to inflict Shock equivalent to that applied by her Ultimate to the attacked enemy target for 2 turns. This effect can only be triggered 1 time per turn.

- Technique - Mercy Is Not Forgiveness

- Immediately attacks all enemies within a set range. After entering battle, deals Lightning DMG equal to 50% of Kafka's ATK to all enemies, with a 100% base chance to inflict Shock equivalent to that applied by her Ultimate on every enemy target for 2 turn(s).

### Major Traces:

- Thorns

- The base chance for Ultimate, Technique, or the follow-up attack triggered by the Talent to inflict Shock increases by 30%.

- Plunder

- If an enemy is defeated while Shocked, Kafka additionally regenerates 5 Energy.

- Torture

- When the Ultimate is used, enemy targets will now receive DMG immediately from all currently applied DoT sources instead of just receiving DMG immediately from the currently applied Shock state.

### Minor Traces:
- 18% Effect Hit Rate

- 28% ATK

- 10% Max HP

## Kafka Playstyle

Kafka teams are dependent on Kafka’s procs of Damage over Time applied to enemies with her Skill and her Ultimate; thus, the best Kafka team rotations are going to be those that consistently apply Damage over Time effects and DEF/RES debuffs to enemies before trying to use as many Skill and Ultimate casts as Kafka can get. More on specific team rotations will be covered in the Team Compositions section, but it’s important to note that, outside of team specific rotational requirements (such as needing to use a Skill for a unit to get their energy filled back in time to use their Ultimate again), the goal should be to ensure Kafka uses her Skill as often as possible on Damage over Time-afflicted enemies. Ideal Kafka gameplay will have few, if any, Kafka Basic Attacks (not including her Follow-up Attack here; that should be proc’d every turn, if possible, by having an ally use a Basic Attack, as the Follow-up Attack deals damage, gains Kafka energy, and applies/re-applies her Shock to the target enemy). The rest of Kafka’s team’s playstyle revolves around how that team functions, some of which are covered in more detail later.

### Opener

If Kafka doesn’t have her Ultimate available and will be facing multiple enemies (as is usually the case), then it’s best to begin with Kafka’s Technique so as to apply Shock to all enemy units, so that she can use her Skill on her first turn and proc her Shock again. Otherwise, against a single target, an ally can use a Basic Attack to trigger Kafka’s Follow-up to apply her Shock (if said ally is faster than Kafka).

The remainder of the rotation depends on which team Kafka is in, though in general, Kafka could attempt to always use her Skill until she can cast her Ultimate.

## Eidolons

Kafka’s Eidolons, in general, give fairly significant damage increases but are unnecessary for Kafka’s core gameplay loop. The eidolons are listed below with some sample percent damage increases, though these are not absolute; they indicate the approximate damage increase one might expect for some of the fully built Kafka teams noted in the “Team Compositions” section, so the damage gained by some eidolons may differ from these projections based on how one’s Kafka team is built.

===

E1: Da Capo - ~17% more team damage against a single target

When the Talent triggers a follow-up attack, there is a 100% base chance to increase the DoT received by the target by 30% for 2 turn(s).
